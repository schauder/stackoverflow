== Stackoverflow Samples

This is a collection of samples for reproducing issues raised on Stackoverflow.

Each sample is a separate application, typically based on Spring Boot.
They are organised into folders by persistence technology.

Samples won't get updated to newer versions except when also the Stackoverflow answer gets updated.
