This tries to reproduce the problems mentioned in
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77174825/like-ignore-case-in-spring-data-jdbc-with-criteria

Symptoms are that the pageable of a `Query` get ignored by the `JdbcAggregateTemplate` in combination with a like-ignore-case.

After some experimentation it seems this is a bug of `JdbcAggregateTemplate.findAll(Query, Class)`.
If the `Pageable` passed as a separate argument using `JdbcAggregateTemplate.findAll(Query, Class, Pageable)` everything seems to work fine.
